Patched "fork" fixed for saves/dupes from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2700690811

I did not get permission to modify this code. Talos forbid I chose to improve your AI-generated code instead of letting it rot and keep this to myself.

> [!WARNING]
> I had to move some things around. You might experience bugs that I didn't test for.
> You might also experience crashes if you have lots (>50) of selfillum models because of the awful hack I did to make saves work. :)
